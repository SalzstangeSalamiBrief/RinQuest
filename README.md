## Inspiration
The Inspiration for creating this game came from the second Season of the Anime [New Game!!](https://myanimelist.net/anime/34914/New_Game) from [Studio Doga Kobo](http://www.dogakobo.com). In This Anime the Character "Sakura Nene" created a game named "Nene Quest", which is the inspiration for this project.

## Disclaimer
I do not own any rights at the Anime "New Game" nor the used assets for the characters. Also there are no creators of this Anime involved in this project.

## Credits
Thanks to the user [Payotz](https://github.com/Payotz) for providing assets from a similar project [Nene_quest](https://github.com/Payotz/Nene_Quest). Using this assets reduced the development time, because i had not to create them by myself.
